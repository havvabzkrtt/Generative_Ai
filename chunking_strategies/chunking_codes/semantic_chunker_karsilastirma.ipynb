Seine Nehri'nin kıyısında yer alan bu büyüleyici şehir, muhteşem mimarisi, sanat eserleri ve romantizmiyle dünya genelinde büyük ilgi görüyor. Efsanevi Eiffel Kulesi, tarihi Notre-Dame Katedrali ve Louvre Müzesi gibi simge yapılar, Paris'i benzersiz kılan unsurlardan sadece birkaçıdır.\n",

Montmartre gibi bohem bölgelerde dolaşmak, Champs-Élysées'deki lüks mağazalarda alışveriş yapmak veya Seine'in kıyısında romantik bir yürüyüş yapmak, Paris'in sunduğu çeşitli deneyimlerden sadece birkaçıdır. Ayrıca, şehrin zengin gastronomi sahnesi, dünya mutfağının en lezzetli örneklerini sunar.\n",

      "Paris, Fransa'nın başkenti ve en büyük şehri olarak sadece bir yer değil, aynı zamanda Fransız kültürünün ve tarihinin kalbidir. Seine Nehri'nin kıyısında yer alan bu büyüleyici şehir, muhteşem mimarisi, sanat eserleri ve romantizmiyle dünya genelinde büyük ilgi görüyor. Efsanevi Eiffel Kulesi, tarihi Notre-Dame Katedrali ve Louvre Müzesi gibi simge yapılar, Paris'i benzersiz kılan unsurlardan sadece birkaçıdır.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris'in güzellikleri sadece yapılarla sınırlı değildir; şehrin sokaklarındaki atmosfer de benzersizdir. Montmartre gibi bohem bölgelerde dolaşmak, Champs-Élysées'deki lüks mağazalarda alışveriş yapmak veya Seine'in kıyısında romantik bir yürüyüş yapmak, Paris'in sunduğu çeşitli deneyimlerden sadece birkaçıdır. Ayrıca, şehrin zengin gastronomi sahnesi, dünya mutfağının en lezzetli örneklerini sunar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris'in en büyüleyici yanlarından biri de, her köşede romantizminin hissedilmesidir. Gün batımında Seine Nehri'nde romantik bir tekne gezisi yapmak veya Versailles Bahçeleri'nde ay ışığında dolaşmak, Paris'in aşk dolu atmosferini keşfetmenin sadece birkaç yoludur. Tüm bu özellikler bir araya geldiğinde, Paris'in gerçekten de Fransa'nın kalbi olduğu açıkça ortaya çıkar.\n",

      "aspects should be considered: (1) task type (ie, choice of\n",
      "exergames to individually focus on neurocogniti ve functioning)\n",
      "and (2) task demands. To allow individualization of task\n",
      "demands, the following factors should be varied based on the\n",

      "To the best of our knowledge, there has only been 1\n",

      "studies applying exergame-based motor -cogniti ve training in\n",
      "older adults with mNCD or MCI. This also matches the analysis\n",

      "Limitations\n",
      "The outcomes of this qualitati ve study must be interpreted with\n",
      "some caution, considering the following limitations. First, none\n",
      "of the intervie wed patients with mNCD belonged to the clinical\n",
      "subtypes of mild frontotemporal NCD or mNCD with Lewy\n",
      "bodies. Depending on the clinical subtypes and the associated\n",
      "clinical pictures of the patients, different findings may have\n",
      "emer ged from patient intervie ws. However, a substantial fraction\n",
      "(ie, ≥60%) of mild or major NCD is attrib utable to Alzheimer\n",
      "disease, whereas mild vascular NCD is the second most common\n",
      "cause of NCD after Alzheimer disease; frontotemporal NCD\n",
      "only accounts for approximately 5% of cases [9]. Therefore,\n",
      "the included study population appeared to be representati ve of\n",
      "these clinical subtypes. Second, owing to difficulties in\n",
      "recruiting patients, those screened for MCI according to\n",
      "predef ined criteria were recruited in addition to patients with a\n",
      "clinical diagnosis of mNCD, which increased the heterogeneity\n",
      "of the study population. By contrast, in our project, we aimed\n",
      "to develop an individualized exergame-based training concept\n",
      "not only to treat clinically diagnosed patients with mNCD but\n",
      "also to prevent progression to dementia in individuals at risk\n",
      "who might not have been diagnosed (yet). Third, owing to the\n",
      "COVID-19 pandemic, all focus group sessions were held as\n",
      "web-based meetings. Face-to-f ace focus group sessions might\n",
      "have promoted livelier exchanges and may have led to additional\n",

      "representing an intermediate stage of cogniti ve impairment\n",
      "between the normal aging process and dementia [3-9]. The\n",
      "condition MCI has evolved over the last decades [5] and has\n",
      "recently been incorporated in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical\n",
      "Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) and the\n",
      "International Classif ication of Diseases 11th Revision, referred\n",
      "to as mild neurocogniti ve disorder (mNCD) [7,9-11]. The\n",
      "prevalence of mNCD increases with age, while the incidence\n",
      "of mNCD and the progression to dementia is expected to rise,\n",
      "largely because of the globally growing life expectancies and\n",
      "sedentary lifestyles [3,5,12-15]. As currently no effective\n",
      "pharmacological interv entions for patients with mNCD exist\n",
      "[16], alternati ve options to prevent and treat neurocogniti ve\n",
      "disorders are needed. Targeting modif iable risk factors in midlife\n",
      "may hold promise for mitig ating or even preventing\n",
      "neurocogniti ve disorders in later life [17-21]. The modif iable\n",
      "risk factors for mNCD include the presence of vascular risk\n",
      "factors (ie, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\n",
      "coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or strok e) [22-24] or\n",
      "a physically or cogniti vely sedentary lifestyle [25,26].\n",
      "Consequently , changes in lifestyle that increase physical and\n",
      "cogniti ve activity and reduce vascular risk factors are protecti ve\n",
      "against cogniti ve decline [27-35].\n",
      "Exergames have gained growing interest to prevent and treat\n",
      "neurocogniti ve disorders [36-38]. “Exergaming is defined as\n",
      "technology-dri ven physical activities, such as video game play,\n",
      "that requires participants to be physically active or exercise in\n",
      "order to play the game” [39]. One of the major advantages of\n",
      "exergame-based training is that it is widely accepted by\n",
      "individuals with neurocogniti ve disorders. In addition, it\n",
      "increases training adherence and engagement by facilitating\n",
      "training motivation and satisf action [40], which in turn may\n",
      "have a positi ve effect on the effectiveness of impro ving\n",
      "cogniti ve functioning [41]. Furthermore, exergames can be used\n",
      "as a form of simultaneous cogniti ve-motor training with\n",
      "incorporated cogniti ve task demands [42]. Meta-analytic\n",
      "evidence suggests that simultaneous motor -cogniti ve training\n",
      "is the most effective type of training for impro ving cognition\n",
      "in health y older adults (HOA) [43,44] and older adults with\n",
      "mNCD [44-46]. For exergames specif ically , a recent systematic\n",
      "review synthesized evidence from low risk of bias studies\n",
      "showing that there were consistent positi ve effects favoring\n",
      "exergaming in people with mNCD and dementia [40].\n",
      "Nonetheless, it is currently difficult to draw reliable conclusions\n",
      "about the effectiveness of exergaming in preventing and treating\n",
      "neurocogniti ve disorders because of the substantial variations\n",
      "in the exergame-based training used. Therefore, further\n",
      "investig ations are needed for the establishment of effective\n",
      "exergame and training components (ie, exercise and training\n",
      "variables such as the frequenc y, intensity , duration, or volumeof training and the type and content of specif ic exergame\n",
      "scenarios) for cogniti ve functioning that can be applied with\n",
      "confidence in evidence-based exergame interv entions [36].\n",
      "Regarding the design and development of novel exergames, it\n",
      "seems crucial to explicitly include the intended users’\n",
      "perspecti ves [47]. Taking the characteristics, needs, and\n",
      "experiences into account should ensure adequate use and\n",
      "therefore the effectiveness of the solution. Baquero et al [48]\n",
      "pointed out that an end user–centered methodological design is\n",
      "most often adopted in the development of computer -based\n",
      "training programs for cogniti ve rehabilitation of older adults\n",
      "with neurocogniti ve disorders (NCDs). In an ideal case, this\n",
      "process fulfills the international standards for the development\n",
      "of programs including (1) understanding and specifying the\n",
      "conte xt of use (type, characteristics and tasks of users, and\n",
      "physical or social environment), (2) specifying the user\n",
      "requirements, (3) producing design solutions, and (4) evaluating\n",
      "the design [48,49]. So far, only half of the studies reporting\n",
      "computer -based interv entions took the standard “specif ication\n",

      "recommendation that future studies in this field should use an\n",
      "interacti ve and participatory design that explicitly includes end\n",
